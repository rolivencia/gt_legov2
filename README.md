# gt_legov2
A Half-Life Rally 1.1 custom map and original creation, developed between November, 2004 and March, 2005. 
The track is set in a world of LEGO bricks at nighttime. It has a very simple circuit, with exception of a hard 90-degrees curve.
                                                                                                         
The LEGO-themed textures were originally made by LePrau. The sponsor textures were made by Pitstop. The textures are bundled in the .bsp file, so no custom .wad is required.

Screenshots and an overview are included in the repository. Unfortunately, I was unable to recover the .wad file with the textures nor the .rmf/.map source files.

## What is each file?

.nav - It's the file that bots used to know how to navigate through a map. It is required for the 1.6 bots to avoid them behaving awkwardly.

.res - Lists the resources required by the game to be able to download all the map dependencies when downloading the map from a server when you don't have it in your computer.

.bsp - Compiled map. Ready to run in CS 1.6

.rmf - Source of the map. Can be opened with Valve Hammer Editor 3.5. It requires importing the Half-Life 1.1.1.0 textures (halflife.wad) and de_dust2 textures (de_dust2.wad)

.txt - Info file.
